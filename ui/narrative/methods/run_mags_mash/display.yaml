description : |

    <p> Dr. Emiley Eloe-Fadrosh at the Joint Genome Institue led an effort to systematically identify 
    metagenome-assembled genomes across all publicly available metagenome datasets. The process for producing these
    MAGs will be fully described in an upcoming paper. Briefly, all publicly available whole genome shotgun 
    metagenome projects from NCBI SRA and JGI were collected. Screened for common contaminants, trimmed for quality 
    and assembled using the JGI's Metagenome Assembly Pipeline. MAGs were then identified using the JGI MetaBat2 program. 
    Each MAG was assessed for Completeness, Contamination and MIMAG quality. Additionally, each metagenome sample has an entry 
    in the Genomes Online Database (GOLD).</p>
    
    <p> This app allows you to search these ~66k MAGs with your assembly, genome or set of genomes and find all the closely 
    matching MAGs using the MASH program. Sketches are made with a k-size of 21, which should allow for reasonable species level 
    matches.</p>
    
    <p> This app allows for the results to be viewed as a downloadable table, with links to the GOLD and IMG websites, 
    or as an interactive GOLD ecosystem browser. When searching with a set of genomes, the interactive GOLD ecosystem browser 
    gives a heatmap view showing how many matches exist at each GOLD level across all input genomes.</p>
